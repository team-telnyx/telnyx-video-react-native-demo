### Step 2: Create an API KEY

Go to [API Keys](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/api-keys) section and click on `Create API Key` button. It will generate a key for you. Copy and save this key in a safe place and don't share it with anyone it is a sensitive value.

You need this API Key to consume the API `https://api.telnyx.com/v2/rooms` to manage your room ids.
